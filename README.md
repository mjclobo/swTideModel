# swTideModel
A barotropic shallow water model with equilibrium and self-attraction &amp; loading tidal forces

This is a sinlge-layer, inviscid, non-rotating shallow water model with both tidal equilibrium and tidal self-attraction and
loading (SAL) forcing.
This model will be used to test numerical algorithms for applying SAL
terms efficiently with the goal of decreasing how often they need to be calculated.

The current model is well-commented, but not well-documented.
A future version will include a more user-friendly interface and better documentation (e.g., fundamental equations, assumptions, boundary options documentation).
